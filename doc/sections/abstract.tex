  In this work, we use three linear regression methods for the purpose of studying the polynomial fit of two datasets: one generated by Franke's function and one extracted from real terrain data. The standard ordinary least squares and the Ridge regression is implemented, while we use \verb|scikit-learn|'s LASSO model for the LASSO regression.
