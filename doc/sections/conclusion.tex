\section{Conclusion}\label{sec:conclusion}
The aim of this work was to gain a further understanding of machine learning concepts and tools by studying three regression methods. After applying the three different regression models to both Franke's function and the real life terrain data, we conclude that they produce satisfactory predictions in both cases, as long as the parameters are chosen carefully. An exception would be the Lasso prediction of the Franke function, which we did not have the time to debug. For the terrain data, we conclude that the best regression method was Ridge regression, closely followed by LASSO regression and OLS being the most inaccurate.

An interesting prospect for the future could be to try these methods on different datasets, to see how they fare in other scenarios. Given more time and computing power, we could also analyze the whole terrain dataset instead of only the small part we've used.
