\subsection{The bias-variance tradeoff}
With a dataset of values produced from Franke's function, we've fitted a model based on the training set and predicted new data based on the testing set. This was done with a design matrix of increasing degrees, from $1$ to $9$. The following figure \ref{fig:result_complexity} is a plot relating the mean squared error of the model to the complexity (or degree).
